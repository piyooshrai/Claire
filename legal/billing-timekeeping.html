            <h1>Automated Timekeeping and Billing for Law Firms</h1>

    <p>Law firms lose 10-15% of billable time due to inadequate time capture (Clio Legal Trends Report 2024). Attorneys forget to log time entries, underestimate hours worked, or write off time because they can't remember what they did three days ago. This revenue leakage compounds: a $2M firm loses $200K-$300K annually to poor timekeeping. For sole practitioners and small firms, this leakage can mean the difference between profitability and barely breaking even.</p>

    <p>The problem isn't attorney laziness—it's that manual time entry interrupts workflow at the worst possible moments. You're drafting a critical motion, in flow state, making progress. Then you remember: "I need to log time from yesterday." You stop, open your practice management system, try to remember what you did, estimate duration, write a description, and assign it to the correct matter. By the time you return to the motion, you've lost your train of thought. That interruption cost you 15-20 minutes of productivity—plus the 5 minutes spent on time entry itself.</p>

    <p>The solution isn't better discipline or more reminders. It's automation: passive time capture that runs in the background without requiring conscious effort, combined with intelligent prompting that suggests time entries at natural break points rather than interrupting focus work.</p>

    <h2 id="problem">The Time Capture Problem</h2>

    <p>Manual time entry requires attorneys to stop work, recall what they just did, estimate duration, select the correct matter and activity code, and write a description. This interruption breaks flow and often gets deferred until end-of-day—when memory of specific tasks is hazy and accuracy suffers.</p>

    <p>Research shows that <strong>contemporary time entry</strong> (logging time immediately after completing a task) is 23% more accurate than <strong>reconstructed time entry</strong> (remembering and logging time hours or days later). But contemporary entry comes at a cost: constant workflow interruption and loss of focus.</p>

    <p>The typical attorney day involves:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Reading and responding to 30-50 emails (10-15 of which are billable client communications)</li>
        <li>Working on 5-8 different matters</li>
        <li>Attending 2-4 meetings, calls, or court appearances</li>
        <li>Drafting or reviewing 3-5 documents</li>
        <li>Conducting legal research for 1-2 matters</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Each of these activities requires a separate time entry. If you're manually logging time, that's 20-30 time entries per day—each requiring 2-3 minutes of administrative work. That's 40-90 minutes daily spent on time entry instead of billable work.</p>

    <p>I solve this through passive monitoring and intelligent prompting:</p>

    <h3>Email Time Tracking</h3>

    <p>When you send an email related to a client matter (detected by email subject, recipient, or content analysis), I automatically create a draft time entry:</p>

    <p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
    You email opposing counsel: "Re: Smith v. Johnson - Discovery Extension Request"<br>
    <strong>I create:</strong> 0.2 hours | Email to opposing counsel re: discovery extension | Matter: Smith v. Johnson | Activity Code: Correspondence<br>
    <strong>You approve in one click.</strong></p>

    <p>For email threads (multiple back-and-forth messages), I intelligently aggregate time rather than creating separate entries for each message. If you exchange 5 emails over 30 minutes negotiating a settlement term, I create one entry: "0.5 hours, Settlement negotiations via email with opposing counsel."</p>

    <h3>Document Work Tracking</h3>

    <p>When you work on a document in your document management system (iManage, NetDocuments, or network drive integrated with our system), I track the time spent and create entries:</p>

    <p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
    You open "Motion for Summary Judgment - Smith v. Johnson.docx" at 10:00 AM<br>
    You work on it until 11:20 AM (1 hour 20 minutes)<br>
    <strong>I create:</strong> 1.3 hours | Draft motion for summary judgment | Matter: Smith v. Johnson | Activity Code: Pleadings<br>
    <strong>You review and approve.</strong></p>

    <p>I automatically assign activity codes based on document type and file location. A document in the "Pleadings" folder gets activity code "Pleadings." A document in "Discovery/Responses" gets activity code "Discovery." This eliminates the tedious dropdown selection process.</p>

    <h3>Calendar-Based Entries</h3>

    <p>After a client meeting, court appearance, or deposition on your calendar, I prompt:</p>

    <p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
    Your calendar shows: "Smith Deposition, 9:00 AM - 12:00 PM"<br>
    At 12:05 PM, I prompt: "Log time for Smith deposition (3 hours scheduled). Actual time spent?"<br>
    <strong>You respond:</strong> "3.5 hours" (accounting for prep time before and debrief after)<br>
    <strong>I create:</strong> 3.5 hours | Attend deposition of plaintiff | Matter: Smith v. Johnson | Activity Code: Deposition<br></p>

    <p>This catches time that would otherwise be lost—the 30 minutes before the deposition reviewing your outline, the 15 minutes after debriefing with co-counsel.</p>

    <h3>Legal Research Tracking</h3>

    <p>When you conduct legal research using Westlaw, LexisNexis, or other platforms, I track your research session time:</p>

    <p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
    You search Westlaw for cases on summary judgment standard in employment discrimination cases<br>
    Research session: 45 minutes<br>
    <strong>I create:</strong> 0.75 hours | Legal research re: summary judgment standard for discrimination claims | Matter: Smith v. Johnson | Activity Code: Legal Research<br></p>

    <p>I detect which matter you're researching based on open documents, calendar appointments, or I simply ask: "Which matter is this research for?"</p>

    <h3>Intelligent Prompting at Natural Break Points</h3>

    <p>I don't interrupt focus work. Instead, I prompt for time approval at natural break points:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>After you close a document (not while actively editing)</li>
        <li>After a calendar event ends</li>
        <li>When you switch from one matter to another</li>
        <li>At end of day (as a catch-all for any missed entries)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You review a list of suggested time entries, approve with one click, adjust any that need changes (duration or description), and continue working. Total time: 30-60 seconds instead of 40-90 minutes.</p>

    <h2 id="rates">Billing Rate Enforcement & Realization</h2>

    <p>Billing rate errors are surprisingly common in manual systems: associates billed at partner rates, partners doing paralegal work billed at partner rates (when it should be billed at paralegal rates), or custom client rates not applied correctly. These errors either cost the firm money (when caught and written down) or damage client relationships (when not caught and clients dispute invoices).</p>

    <p>I enforce billing rate rules automatically based on configurable rules:</p>

    <h3>Standard Rate Tables</h3>

    <p>You configure your firm's standard rate card:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Partner: $500/hour</li>
        <li>Senior Associate (5+ years): $350/hour</li>
        <li>Junior Associate (0-4 years): $250/hour</li>
        <li>Paralegal: $150/hour</li>
        <li>Legal Assistant: $100/hour</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I automatically apply the correct rate based on who performed the work. When you approve a time entry, I pull your role from the practice management system and apply your rate. No manual rate selection required.</p>

    <h3>Client-Specific Rate Agreements</h3>

    <p>Many clients negotiate custom rates below standard: "We'll pay partner rate of $450 (not $500), senior associate $300 (not $350)." I store these client-specific rate agreements and automatically apply them when generating invoices.</p>

    <p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
    Partner works 5 hours on Matter ABC (standard rate: $500/hour = $2,500)<br>
    Client ABC has negotiated rate: $450/hour<br>
    <strong>Invoice shows:</strong> $2,250 (automatically adjusted)<br>
    <strong>Firm tracks write-down:</strong> $250 attributed to rate discount (not attorney error)</p>

    <p>This distinction matters for compensation and performance reviews. A $250 write-down due to negotiated client rates shouldn't count against the partner's realization metrics.</p>

    <h3>Task-Based Billing & Budget Alerts</h3>

    <p>For alternative fee arrangements (AFAs) and flat-fee matters, I track time against budgeted hours and alert when approaching limits:</p>

    <p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
    Matter: Employment contract review<br>
    Flat fee: $2,500 (estimated 10 hours at $250/hour blended rate)<br>
    Hours logged to date: 8.5 hours<br>
    <strong>Alert to partner:</strong> "Smith Employment Contract matter has consumed 85% of budgeted hours (8.5 of 10 hours). Remaining budget: 1.5 hours."</p>

    <p>This prevents scope creep from silently eroding profitability. The partner can either: (1) complete the work within budget, (2) request additional fees from the client for expanded scope, or (3) accept reduced profitability with eyes open.</p>

    <h3>Write-Down Prevention & Quality Control</h3>

    <p>I flag time entries that exceed reasonable expectations before invoicing, allowing attorneys to revise proactively:</p>

    <p><strong>Example flags:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>"10 hours to draft simple complaint" — Comparable complaints in your system average 3-4 hours. Flag for partner review.</li>
        <li>"0.1 hours for client meeting" — Meeting on calendar was scheduled for 1 hour. Likely data entry error.</li>
        <li>"5.5 hours legal research re: contract interpretation" on a $5,000 contract dispute — Research time exceeds likely matter value. Consider write-down.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These flags appear during the monthly invoice review process, before clients see the bills. Partners can revise descriptions, adjust hours, or provide explanations ("Research required due to novel AI contract provisions—discussed with client who approved additional research time").</p>

    <h3>Realization Rate Tracking</h3>

    <p>I calculate realization rates at multiple levels:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Attorney-level:</strong> How much does each attorney bill vs. collect? (Partner A: 95% realization. Associate B: 78% realization due to frequent write-downs for inefficiency.)</li>
        <li><strong>Matter-level:</strong> Which matters are profitable vs. loss-leaders? (Smith v. Johnson: 102% realization due to premium billing. Jones Estate: 65% realization due to scope creep.)</li>
        <li><strong>Practice area-level:</strong> Which practice areas are most profitable? (Employment litigation: 92% realization. Estate planning: 88% realization.)</li>
        <li><strong>Client-level:</strong> Which clients pay vs. dispute bills? (Client ABC: 98% realization, always pays promptly. Client XYZ: 75% realization, frequent disputes.)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These analytics inform strategic decisions: which attorneys need training, which matters to decline, which practice areas to emphasize, which clients to fire.</p>

    <h2 id="invoices">Automated Invoice Generation</h2>

    <p>Manual invoice generation is a time-consuming, error-prone process. At month-end, paralegals or billing coordinators spend hours pulling reports, verifying time entries, calculating totals, formatting invoices, and routing for attorney approval. For a 10-attorney firm with 50 active matters, this process consumes 20-30 hours of staff time monthly.</p>

    <p>I generate invoices automatically based on your billing cycle (monthly, milestone, upon completion):</p>

    <h3>The Automated Workflow</h3>

    <p><strong>Step 1: Pull Unbilled Time & Expenses</strong><br>
    On the designated billing day (e.g., last day of month), I query your practice management system for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>All time entries marked "billable" but not yet invoiced</li>
        <li>All expenses entered but not yet billed (court filing fees, deposition costs, expert witness fees, travel expenses)</li>
        <li>Matter billing status (is this an hourly matter, flat fee, contingency, or hybrid?)</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Step 2: Apply Rate Tables & Calculations</strong><br>
    For hourly matters:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Apply attorney-specific billing rates (or client-specific negotiated rates if applicable)</li>
        <li>Calculate subtotals by attorney and by task category</li>
        <li>Add expenses at cost or with markup (per client agreement)</li>
        <li>Calculate total fees</li>
    </ul>

    <p>For flat-fee matters:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Check milestone completion status ("Has discovery been completed? Then bill Milestone 2: $5,000.")</li>
        <li>Track internal time against budget (for profitability analysis, not client billing)</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Step 3: Trust Retainer Draw-Down</strong><br>
    If the client has a trust retainer on file:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Apply invoice amount against retainer balance</li>
        <li>Update retainer balance</li>
        <li>If retainer drops below threshold (e.g., $5,000), flag for replenishment request</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Step 4: Generate Formatted Invoice</strong><br>
    Using your firm's template (letterhead, format, terms), I generate:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>PDF invoices</strong> for standard clients (formatted for email or postal mail)</li>
        <li><strong>LEDES format</strong> for corporate clients requiring standardized electronic billing</li>
        <li><strong>Custom formats</strong> for clients with specific requirements (e.g., government agencies with specialized invoice requirements)</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Step 5: Route for Attorney Approval</strong><br>
    I send draft invoices to the responsible attorney for review:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Attorney reviews time entries for accuracy</li>
        <li>Attorney may adjust descriptions, write down hours, or add narrative explanations</li>
        <li>Attorney approves (one click)</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Step 6: Send to Client</strong><br>
    Upon approval, I automatically:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Email PDF invoice to client billing contact</li>
        <li>Upload to client portal (if your firm uses one)</li>
        <li>Create accounts receivable record in your accounting system</li>
        <li>Mark all time entries and expenses as "billed" (preventing double-billing)</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Total time from "generate" to sent: 30-60 seconds per invoice</strong> (compared to 30-60 minutes for manual invoicing).</p>

    <h3>Invoice Customization & Narrative</h3>

    <p>Invoices aren't just line items—they're communication tools that justify your fees. I support customization:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Narrative descriptions:</strong> "This month we completed discovery, including three depositions, review of 5,000 pages of documents, and drafting of summary judgment motion. We are well-positioned for favorable resolution."</li>
        <li><strong>Value explanations:</strong> "The research we conducted identified a procedural defect in opposing counsel's motion, which resulted in dismissal and saved you an estimated $50,000 in expert witness costs."</li>
        <li><strong>Phase-based summaries:</strong> Group time entries by litigation phase (Pleadings: $5,000, Discovery: $12,000, Motions: $8,000) rather than chronological listing.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These narrative elements are templates you configure once and I auto-populate with matter-specific details.</p>

    <h2 id="collections">Collections Automation</h2>

    <p>Generating invoices is only half the battle—collecting payment is the other half. Law firms struggle with collections: clients forget to pay, dispute bills after the fact, or simply ignore invoices hoping the firm will write off small balances. The ABA reports that 15-20% of law firm accounts receivable are never collected, representing hundreds of thousands in lost revenue for mid-size firms.</p>

    <p>I automate collections workflows to improve payment velocity and reduce write-offs:</p>

    <h3>Automated Payment Reminders</h3>

    <p>I send reminder emails at strategic intervals based on payment terms:</p>

    <p><strong>Timeline (for standard 30-day net payment terms):</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Day 0:</strong> Invoice sent with payment instructions</li>
        <li><strong>Day 7:</strong> Friendly reminder: "Your invoice for Matter XYZ was sent on [date]. Payment is due on [date]. Please contact us if you have questions."</li>
        <li><strong>Day 23 (one week before due date):</strong> Courtesy reminder: "Your invoice for $X is due in 7 days. You can pay online using this link: [payment portal]."</li>
        <li><strong>Day 30 (due date):</strong> Due date notice: "Your invoice for $X is due today. Please remit payment or contact us to arrange a payment plan."</li>
        <li><strong>Day 37 (one week overdue):</strong> Overdue notice: "Your invoice for $X is now 7 days overdue. Please remit payment immediately. [Late fee notice if applicable per engagement letter.]"</li>
        <li><strong>Day 45 (15 days overdue):</strong> Escalation to responsible attorney for personal follow-up</li>
        <li><strong>Day 60 (30 days overdue):</strong> Final notice before suspension of services or referral to collections</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These reminders are automatically generated and sent, but you can customize tone, frequency, and escalation triggers based on client relationships. For example:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Long-term clients with excellent payment history: Fewer reminders, more lenient tone</li>
        <li>New clients or clients with past payment issues: More frequent reminders, firmer tone</li>
        <li>Corporate clients with 60-day payment cycles: Adjusted timeline to match their A/P processes</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Payment Processing & Tracking</h3>

    <p>I integrate with legal payment processors (LawPay, LawPay, AffiniPay) to enable online payment:</p>

    <p><strong>Features:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Payment links in invoices:</strong> Every invoice includes a "Pay Online" button that takes clients directly to a secure payment portal</li>
        <li><strong>Credit card & ACH processing:</strong> Clients can pay by credit card (with processing fees passed to client if allowed by state bar rules) or bank transfer (ACH)</li>
        <li><strong>IOLTA compliance:</strong> For trust retainer payments, I ensure funds are routed to your IOLTA account, not operating account</li>
        <li><strong>Automatic receipt generation:</strong> When payment is received, I generate a receipt and email it to the client</li>
        <li><strong>Accounting system integration:</strong> I update your accounting system (QuickBooks, Xero) to mark invoices as paid and reconcile against bank deposits</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Payment status tracking:</strong><br>
    I monitor payment status in real-time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Paid in full → Mark invoice closed, update A/R balance, send receipt</li>
        <li>Partial payment → Apply to oldest outstanding balance first (or per client instruction), update A/R, notify attorney if repeated partial payments indicate financial distress</li>
        <li>Payment failed (e.g., credit card declined) → Immediately notify client and request alternative payment method</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Accounts Receivable Aging Reports</h3>

    <p>I generate A/R aging reports automatically (weekly or on-demand) showing:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Current (0-30 days):</strong> Invoices within payment terms</li>
        <li><strong>31-60 days:</strong> Slightly overdue, requires follow-up</li>
        <li><strong>61-90 days:</strong> Significantly overdue, at risk of write-off</li>
        <li><strong>90+ days:</strong> Likely uncollectible without aggressive action</li>
    </ul>

    <p>For each aging category, I flag:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Total dollar amount outstanding</li>
        <li>Number of invoices</li>
        <li>Clients with largest balances (prioritize collection efforts)</li>
        <li>Trend analysis: Is A/R increasing or decreasing month-over-month?</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Automated escalation:</strong><br>
    Matters with invoices overdue >60 days are automatically flagged for partner review. Partner decides whether to:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Suspend work until payment received (protect against further losses)</li>
        <li>Arrange payment plan (preserve client relationship for good clients with temporary cash flow issues)</li>
        <li>Refer to collections agency (for unresponsive clients or bad actors)</li>
        <li>Write off as bad debt (for small balances not worth pursuing)</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Payment Plans & Settlements</h3>

    <p>For clients struggling with large invoices, I facilitate payment plans:</p>

    <p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
    Client owes $15,000 but can't pay in full. Partner negotiates: $5,000 upfront + $2,000/month for 5 months.<br>
    I create payment plan schedule, send monthly invoices for installment amounts, track compliance, and alert partner if client misses a payment.</p>

    <p>For disputed invoices, I facilitate settlements:<br>
    Client disputes $5,000 of a $20,000 invoice. Partner negotiates settlement: Client pays $17,500 to close out matter.<br>
    I process the adjusted invoice, mark original invoice as settled, and document the write-off reason (dispute settlement) for tax and management reporting purposes.</p>

    <h2 id="roi">ROI: Recovered Billable Time & Faster Cash Flow</h2>

    <p>The financial impact of automated timekeeping and billing goes beyond labor savings—it fundamentally improves both top-line revenue (through better time capture) and cash flow (through faster billing and collections).</p>

    <h3>Recovered Billable Time</h3>

    <p>For a 10-attorney firm with 15,000 annual billable hours target:</p>

    <p><strong>Current State:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Target billable hours: 15,000 (1,500 hours per attorney)</li>
        <li>Time leakage: 10% = 1,500 unbilled hours</li>
        <li>Average billing rate: $300/hour (blended across partners, associates, paralegals)</li>
        <li>Annual revenue loss: 1,500 hours × $300 = <strong>$450,000</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>With Automated Time Capture:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Time leakage: 2% = 300 unbilled hours</li>
        <li>Recovered hours: 1,200 hours</li>
        <li>Recovered revenue: 1,200 hours × $300 = <strong>$360,000/year</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Administrative Time Savings</h3>

    <p>Beyond recovered billable time, automation saves administrative time:</p>

    <p><strong>Manual Process:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Attorneys spend 10-15 minutes/day on time entry = 2.5 hours/week per attorney</li>
        <li>10 attorneys × 2.5 hours = 25 hours/week firm-wide</li>
        <li>50 billable weeks/year = 1,250 hours annually</li>
        <li>At $300/hour average rate = $375,000 opportunity cost (time spent on admin instead of billable work)</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Automated Process:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Attorneys spend 2-3 minutes/day reviewing and approving suggested time entries = 0.5 hours/week per attorney</li>
        <li>10 attorneys × 0.5 hours = 5 hours/week firm-wide</li>
        <li>50 billable weeks/year = 250 hours annually</li>
        <li>Time saved: 1,000 hours/year = $300,000 in reallocated attorney capacity</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Billing staff savings:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Manual invoice generation: 20-30 hours/month for 50 active matters = $18,000-$27,000 annual cost (at $75/hour billing coordinator rate)</li>
        <li>Automated invoice generation: 5-8 hours/month (attorney review only) = $4,500-$7,200 annual cost</li>
        <li>Savings: $13,500-$19,800/year</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Faster Cash Flow</h3>

    <p>Accelerating billing and collections improves working capital:</p>

    <p><strong>Manual Process:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Billing lag: 30-45 days from month-end to invoice sent</li>
        <li>Payment terms: 30 days</li>
        <li>Total days to payment: 60-75 days from work performed</li>
        <li>Average outstanding A/R: $300,000-$400,000</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Automated Process:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Billing lag: 1-3 days from month-end to invoice sent</li>
        <li>Payment terms: 30 days</li>
        <li>Automated reminders improve payment compliance (reduces actual payment time from 45 days to 35 days)</li>
        <li>Total days to payment: 31-35 days from work performed</li>
        <li>Average outstanding A/R: $150,000-$175,000</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Working capital improvement:</strong> $150,000-$225,000 additional cash on hand (equivalent to eliminating a line of credit or improving investment returns)</p>

    <h3>Improved Realization Rates</h3>

    <p>Better time descriptions, proactive write-down prevention, and faster billing improve collection rates:</p>

    <p><strong>Current realization rate:</strong> 85% (industry average)<br>
    <strong>With Claire:</strong> 92% (7-point improvement)<br>
    <strong>On $2M annual billings:</strong> 7% × $2M = <strong>$140,000 additional collected revenue</strong></p>

    <h3>Total Annual Financial Impact</h3>

    <p>Adding it all together for a 10-attorney firm:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Recovered billable time (reduced leakage): $360,000</li>
        <li>Reallocated attorney admin time to billable work: $300,000</li>
        <li>Billing staff savings: $16,000</li>
        <li>Improved realization rates: $140,000</li>
        <li>Working capital improvement (cash flow): $187,500 (midpoint, one-time benefit)</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Total Annual Benefit: $816,000+</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Claire Professional Tier Cost: $48,000/year</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Net Benefit: $768,000</strong></p>

    <p><strong>ROI: 1,600%</strong></p>

    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion: Time is Money—Especially When It's Recovered</h2>

    <p>The math is stark: law firms are bleeding hundreds of thousands of dollars annually through poor timekeeping, delayed billing, and inadequate collections. Automation doesn't just save time—it fundamentally transforms law firm economics by:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Capturing billable time that would otherwise be lost</li>
        <li>Freeing attorneys from administrative drudgery to focus on billable work</li>
        <li>Accelerating cash flow through faster billing and collections</li>
        <li>Improving realization rates through better time descriptions and proactive quality control</li>
    </ol>

    <p>For most law firms, automated timekeeping and billing pays for itself within the first 30 days. The question isn't whether to automate—it's how quickly you can implement to stop the revenue leakage.</p>
